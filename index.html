<h2>Ethan and Stanley are looking for a Surrogate</h2>


<img></img>

<p>We are growing our family and are so excited to have a child! Turns out, it’s kinda tricky for two guys to do that. So, we are looking to our community of family, friends, and friends-of-friends to see if we might find a really amazing person to help us with this process by being our Surrogate.</p>
        
<b>About Us</b> 
<p>We met 10 years ago at a party where Stanley was singing and Ethan was secretly recording the concert! On our first date, Ethan revealed that he had a playlist from that night and Stanley revealed that he had been stalking Ethan on Facebook while he was in grad school. Talent crushes quickly became deep admiration and love and 7 years later to the day we got married in the Berkshire mountains under a grove of birch trees.</p>
    
<p>Ethan grew up in Washington DC, has three terrific sisters, and has lived on the east coast his whole life. Stanley grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and has a large extended family including a brother and sister-in-law who have adorable twin girls. We love to travel (Italy, China, Mexico…), play tennis, host BBQs with friends, and binge watch RuPaul’s Drag Race. We both love and work in the arts. Stanley is a performer who was in three Broadway shows and a really fun Netflix TV show. Now he runs a production company and helps nonprofits plan their events. Ethan is co-founder of Heartbeat Opera, known for radically re-envisioning the classics. Ethan has just accepted a new role as Associate Artistic Director at a theater in Washington DC. We are so excited to be in Ethan’s hometown and take this next step in our life together: a baby!</p>

    <ul>
