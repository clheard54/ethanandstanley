      <p class="text-start">We are growing our family and are so excited to have a child! Turns out, it’s kinda tricky for two guys to do that. So, we are looking to our community of family, friends, and friends-of-friends to see if we might find a really amazing person to help us with this process by being our Surrogate.</p>
    <br/>

      <span class="bold">About Us</span> 
      <p class="text">We met 10 years ago at a party where Stanley was singing and Ethan was secretly recording the concert! On our first date, Ethan revealed that he had a playlist from that night and Stanley revealed that he had been stalking Ethan on Facebook while he was in grad school. Talent crushes quickly became deep admiration and love and 7 years later to the day we got married in the Berkshire mountains under a grove of birch trees.</p>

      <p class="text">Ethan grew up in Washington DC, has three terrific sisters, and has lived on the east coast his whole life. Stanley grew up in Columbus, Ohio, and has a large extended family including a brother and sister-in-law who have adorable twin girls. We love to travel (Italy, China, Mexico…), play tennis, host BBQs with friends, and binge watch RuPaul’s Drag Race. We both love and work in the arts. Stanley is a performer who was in three Broadway shows and a really fun Netflix TV show. Now he runs a production company and helps nonprofits plan their events. Ethan is co-founder of Heartbeat Opera, known for radically re-envisioning the classics. Ethan has just accepted a new role as Associate Artistic Director at a theater in Washington DC. We are so excited to be in Ethan’s hometown and take this next step in our life together: a baby!</p>

  <span class="bold">About You</span>
    <p class="text">Being a surrogate is a tremendous act of generosity. The wonderwomen who offer to carry a pregnancy for someone else are incredibly loving, strong, and altruistic humans. We know that, most of all, our surrogate will be someone who believes in her heart that she wants to help us – two gay guys – have a child. With our surrogacy agency, we will do everything we can to support our surrogate through the process, providing emotional guidance with a social worker, legal support, and financial compensation. </p>
    <p class="text">Based on our clinic’s screening process a good candidate needs to meet a few requirements:</p>
        <ul>    
        <li>21-40 years old</li>
        <li>US Citizen living in a surrogacy friendly state (Most states are friendly! The exceptions are: MI, NE, LA, IN, AZ)</li>
        <li>Had one successful pregnancy and delivered at least one child</li>
        <li>No more than 3 cesarian sections</li>
        <li>BMI of less than 33</li>
        <li>Non-smoker, Non-drug user</li>
        </ul>

    <p class="text-bottom">Most of all, our surrogate is someone who is in a good place in their life and believes in helping two terrific gay guys make a family. With our agency, we will support our surrogate through the process, providing emotional guidance, legal support, and financial compensation.</p>
